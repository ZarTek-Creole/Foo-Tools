MP3INFO

Building:
---------
mod_idmp3 depends on the mp3info package. You can download the latest
version from: http://ibiblio.org/mp3info/

After downloading, unpack it, and link the dir to the path of mod_mp3info

Eg.

cd footools/src/pre/modules
tar zcvf /path/to/mp3info-x.x.x.tgz
ln -s mp3info-x.x.x mp3info

so that you have the dir
footools/src/pre/modules/mp3info

Now you can run 'make' in this dir and it will hopefully build
mod_idmp3.so :-)

When you have mod_idmp3.so, then copy it to /glftpd/bin/premodules
and add it to the modules list in pre.cfg like this:

modules=/bin/premodules/mod_idmp3.so

If you have more modules already loaded, then it will look like this

modules=/bin/premodules/mod_other.so|/bin/premodules/mod_whatever.so|/bin/premodules/mod_idmp3.so

Note, that I have been working with mp3info-0.8.4 so if you have a
different version, and its not working, then find the older version
(which is also available on the url above), before you bug me.


Output:
-------

output from mod_idmp3 can be configured using the setting:

mod_idmp3.output=output string

in pre.cfg, default output string is:

PRE-MP3INFO: "%R" "%a" "%l" "%y" "%g" "%G" "%r" "%Q" "%o" "%m" "%s" "%S" "%L"

The variables are (mostly, some are missing) the same as in mp3info so
if you know that program, you should be familiar with this too.

%R - release name, eg. Me_and_Myself-My_Leet_Tracks-2003-Whatever
%a - artist
%l - album name
%y - year
%g - genre (string)
%G - genre (id)
%r - bitrate in Kbit/s
%Q - sampling frequency in Hz
%o - mode, stereo/mono
%m - playing time, minutes only, NYI
%s - playing time, seconds only (%m:%s -> total playing time, min+sec), NYI
%S - playing time total seconds (%S -> total playing time, sec), NYI
%L - mpeg layer

NYI = not yet implemented.


Sitebot:
--------

pzs-ng's ngBot.conf:

set redirect(PRE-MP3INFO)  $mainchan
set disable(PRE-MP3INFO)   0
set chanlist(PRE-MP3INFO)  $mainchan
set variables(PRE-MP3INFO) "%releasename %artist %album %year %genre %genre_id %bitrate %sampling %mode %none %none %none %mpeglayer"
lappend msgtypes(DEFAULT)   "PRE-MP3INFO"

default theme:

announce.PRE-MP3INFO            = "[%b{%c1{pre-mp3info}}] %artist - %album :: %b{%genre}(genre_id) from %year at %b{%sampling}Hz in %b{%mode} %b{%bitrate}kbps (%mpeglayer)"
